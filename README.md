# Shadowverse Tracker

This was created to allow users to track and and view statistics of their **Shadowverse** games, forked from [sleeplessghost/ShadowverseTracker](https://github.com/sleeplessghost/ShadowverseTracker).

You can filter the games by:
* Craft played (player and opponent).
* Deck played (player and opponent).
* Whether you went first or second.

Also included with the release is an Icon Changer in case you don't like the current icon.

**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/shadowversedecktracker/ShadowverseDeckTracker/wiki) for the FAQ and installation, usage, and contribution guides.**

## Future Goals
* In-game overlay similar to [Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) showing played cards/deck and other useful statistics.
* Automatically read data from Shadowverse so games don't need to be manually enterred.
* Allow users to sync data to a server (card collection, decks and deck statistics, player statistics).
* Provide a score calculator (e.g. how many games would it take to get to X rank).
* Add some sort of deck management.
* Add import from ```.csv```.
* Add automatic updating.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests
If you encounter a bug while using the software that is not due to user error or would like to request a feature, head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/shadowversedecktracker/ShadowverseDeckTracker/issues) tab and create a new issue. Your issue will be reviewed and tagged accordingly.
